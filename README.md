# RandomStuff
A collection of random stuff which aren't significant enough to deserve their own seperate repositories.


# ZeroPingEtherwarp
Instantly teleports you to the target block when shift + right clicking with an etherwarp item using accurate etherwarp prediction.

NOTE: RISKY! Currently, the server does not ban for long teleports, so this should be safe to use so long as you don't try to spam it in places where etherwarp is disabled.
Because I'm not doing any funky packet stuff, this is not true zero ping; as in, you will still need to wait for the server to process the etherwarp before you can change directions. However, it is still a huge improvement over not using it at all.

You might still be lagged back to the etherwarp location once the server catches up, so expect it to feel a bit janky. This will be less prevalent for players with lower ping.

Config gui: /zeropingetherwarp (or /zpew)


# PianoProdigy
Harp should not be part of progressing.

Does harp for you!

/harpdelay \<ticks\> to change delay. Lower values recommended for faster songs.

Detects the wool block one slot before you should click, so low ping players should have their delay set higher than players with high ping. For me (250ms) on the faster songs, 2-3 ticks of delay works reliably.


# IHateCarpet
Literally just turns carpets near you into ghost blocks temporarily so watchdog screams at you less.
